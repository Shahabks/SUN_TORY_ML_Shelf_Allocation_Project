### Analysis and Algorithms:EXPERIMENT
#### PCA, Correlation, Extract Trees Classifier 
#### Linear/Non-Linear Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes. Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors,. Classification and Regression Trees.

### Python 3.6 64bit, Worked well/checked on Google Colab and Dell Inspiron i5577 for large dataset
### The algorithm comes with a sample dataset 27(column)x9215(rows) which is extendable (I assigned random/sample names to each column, you may revise them) 
#### When you run the algorithm, a popup asks you the path to the dataset directory (you may revise it)
### the algorithm generates/saves (in the same directory as the main dataset) a few *.csv files (statistics, correlation,factors) and *.sav models
